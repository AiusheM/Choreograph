Ph: Reverse retimer.
Ph: Mix combiner (lerp between two values).

Sa: Loop Motion. Set time to zero on finish.
    PingPong Motion. * -1 speed on finish.
    Reverse Motion. Negative speed; set time to end.

Raise phrase - take one-dimensional phrases and combine into a higher-dimensional phrase.

  Only thing that could mess up an existing motion (badly) would be to shorten the sequence while playing.

More samples.
