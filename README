sc-Choreograph
A simple animation and timing library intended for use with the Cinder framework. Initial inspiration came from the TweenMax library for AS3.

Status
Tweens and Cues are part of a Sequence, which is the primary interface for users
Templated tweens support all types which implement + and * operations
Cues can call any boost::function<void ()> at a chosen point in the Sequence
Easing functions integrated, and can be used as a stand-alone module
Memory management through shared_ptr
Flexible step() method allows for user-controlled time

Untested
Sequences can be nested in each other

UPDATE:
Choreograph was the initial implementation of what is now ci::Timeline. For a more
robust and complete tweening experience, use the latest version of Cinder. Andrew
Bell expanded upon the ideas in this library and made a really solid, safe tweening
library that's built into Cinder. I recommend it.

Choreograph will stick around here as a memorial to tweens past.
