sc-Choreograph
A simple animation and timing library intended for use with the Cinder framework.

Status
Templated tweens support all types which implement + and * operations
Easing functions are implemented, and can be used as a stand-alone module
Memory management through shared_ptr
Flexible step() method allows for user-controlled time
Looping, ping-ponging, and reversing of tweens
Tweens live on a Timeline, which is the primary interface for users

To Do:
callbacks on tween complete
callbacks on timeline complete (maybe timelines only, and they should be considered the atomic unit)
actions that can live on timelines but aren't tweens (callbacks at a given time)
support for sequencing tweens of a single variable
