sc-Choreograph
A simple animation and timing library intended for use with the Cinder framework.

Status
Templated tweens support all types which implement + and * operations
Easing functions are implemented, and can be used as a stand-alone module
Memory management through shared_ptr
Flexible step() method allows for user-controlled time
User-controlled time makes slow-mo and reverse simple

To Do:
callbacks on tween complete
Reversing, ping-ponging, and looping with new step() time
proper sequencing of tweens in timeline by start time (current model is fragile)
actions that can live on timelines
support for chaining and sequencing tweens
